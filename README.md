# My First GitHub Repository

Hi, I am Arindee.

This repository is part of my learning journey to understand how GitHub works.
I am using it to practice creating repositories, adding files, and writing README
documents before organizing my professional portfolio.

My main career focus is Business Analysis, and my BA-related work is available
in separate repositories.
